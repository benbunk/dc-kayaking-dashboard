# How to make a go-no-go call for Kayaking

1. 120 Rule Temperature - Ambient Air Temperature + Water Temperature >= 120
2. Windspeed and Direction - Wind Speeds >= 10 mph sustained or 25 mph gusts are annoying. Head wind >= 7 mph can create negative progress.
3. Water Level - <= Action Stage. Minimum 2.25 feet on Seneca Creek
4. Water Volume - I don't track this currently, water level is a good enough indicator on the Potomac.
5. Lightning - Obviously don't be on the water.
6. Chance of Rain - >= 30% Chance on the radar == 100% chance at the river.
7. Sunset - Civil Twilight + 30 minutes (May - September) is maximum without Head Lamps.
